<p align="left">I’ve been the type of person who wanted to see how things connect. I didn’t just want an answer, I wanted to know the reasoning behind it.<br><br>I think of challenges like mazes. At first, they look complicated, but if you take it step by step, the path slowly reveals itself. I like breaking problems into smaller parts, studying them carefully, and finding where they lead. Quick fixes don’t satisfy me, I want to understand the real cause and how to improve it for good.</p>
