<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ What's up?</h1>

<p align="left">Iâ€™ve been the type of person who wanted to see how things connect. I didnâ€™t just want an answer, I wanted to know the reasoning behind it.<br><br>I think of challenges like mazes. At first, they look complicated, but if you take it step by step, the path slowly reveals itself. I like breaking problems into smaller parts, studying them carefully, and finding where they lead. Quick fixes donâ€™t satisfy me, I want to understand the real cause and how to improve it for good.<br><br>I enjoy learning new things, thinking critically, and relying on facts. To me, every challenge has a hidden pattern, and once you recognize it, the solution becomes clearer and more meaningful.</p>
